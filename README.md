#codeX SpringBoard

Let's get going with Codex it will be an adventure and a challenge, but never boring.

## Creating an online home

As a coder as codeX the internet will be your home away from home, it’s where you will learn and learn to learn. If you don’t know something don’t fear: the internet is near. 

If you don't know something, the internet is your friend and it's a great place to share with others what you know and learn. This journey of discovery and sharing will be an integral part of your codeX journey. 

If anything of the things below make no sense - follow the codeX learning cycle:
 * Write it down on a post-it note - keep these close to you and we will review them regularly.
 * Then google it 
 * If still in doubt wave a mentor closer to talk it through

## Usefull resources

Here are a list of free online resources that you wil find helpfull in your codeX journey. Hold them dear, study them, discuss them and use them to your advantage.

Ok you must admit this was epic. You potentially got freaked out along the way a few times, but you now know more about HTML, CSS, Javascript, HTTP & GIT. Not bad going, keep it up this is just the start. Remember to keep on reading about the skills you learned so far. Maybe make a list of things that doesn't make sense and be sure to talk these through with your fellow codeXers and mentors.
